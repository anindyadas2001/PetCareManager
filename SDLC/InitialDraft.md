#### **2. Detailed Pipeline Stages**

##### **Stage 1: Source Control and Versioning**

- **Repository Hosting**: Use **GitHub** or **GitLab** to host the PetCare Manager v2 codebase.
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - **Main Branch**: Stable production-ready code.
  - **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for features.
  - **Feature Branches**: Individual branches for new features or bug fixes.
- **Webhooks**: Configure webhooks to trigger Jenkins jobs on code commits or pull requests.

##### **Stage 2: Continuous Integration with Jenkins**

- **Jenkins Server Setup**:
  - **Hosting**: Deploy Jenkins on an **AWS EC2** instance.
  - **Security**: Secure Jenkins with proper IAM roles and Security Groups.
  - **Plugins**: Install necessary plugins (e.g., Git, Maven, Ansible, Terraform, AWS, SonarQube).

- **Pipeline Configuration**:
  - **Jenkinsfile**: Define the pipeline as code within the repository for versioning and easy management.

##### **Stage 3: Pipeline Stages Breakdown**

1. **Source Stage**
   - **Trigger**: Code push or pull request to the repository.

     ```hcl
     provider "aws" {
       region = "us-east-1"
     }

     resource "aws_instance" "jenkins" {
       ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
       instance_type = "t2.medium"
       key_name      = "your-key-pair"

       tags = {
         Name = "JenkinsServer"
       }

       security_groups = [aws_security_group.jenkins_sg.name]
     }

     resource "aws_security_group" "jenkins_sg" {
       name        = "jenkins_sg"
       description = "Allow SSH and HTTP"

       ingress {
         from_port   = 22
         to_port     = 22
         protocol    = "tcp"
         cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
       }

       ingress {
         from_port   = 8080
         to_port     = 8080
         protocol    = "tcp"
         cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
       }

       egress {
         from_port   = 0
         to_port     = 0
         protocol    = "-1"
         cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
       }
     }
     ```

             state: present

         - name: Install Tomcat
           yum:
             name: tomcat
             state: present

         - name: Start Tomcat
           service:
             name: tomcat
             state: started

           service:
             name: tomcat
             state: restarted
     ```
   - **Inventory Management**:
     - Define EC2 instances in Ansible inventory for targeted configuration.
     - Example `hosts` file:
       ```
       [tomcat]
       ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
       ```
   - **Outcome**: Automated configuration and deployment of the application.

     - Restart Tomcat to apply the new deployment.
   - **Ansible Tasks**:
     - As shown in the Configuration Management Stage.
   - **Outcome**: Application is deployed and live on AWS EC2.

9. **Post-Deployment Stage**
   - **Monitoring**: **AWS CloudWatch**
     - **Action**:
       - Monitor application logs and performance metrics.
       - Set up alarms for critical metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory).
   - **Notifications**:
     - Configure Jenkins to send notifications via email or Slack on pipeline status (success/failure).
